I had a fun day today, school was good.
I went to the skatepark for a bit, I bought a skateboard yesterday in Amsterdam.
At a place called Toms Skateshop. It was a nice store, there was just one guy working at the store on that day, he helped me to assemble the board
and I got back into the car and went home.

For the rest of the day: I just had dinner it was quite good.
Im currently writing this first blog post and soon going to see if I can get this Gemini Capsule hosted.

Thats all for today, See you next time!
